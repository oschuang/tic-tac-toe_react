## Description

Classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in React with help of Create-React-App.

You can play it here: https://oschuang.github.io/tic-tac-toe_react/

## Features

Includes one-player mode vs. AI, and a two-player mode to play locally with a friend.

## AI

The AI for one-player mode was configured to be defensive, so it will stop the opponent from making a winning move if it detects one. The AI was implemented using a Map.


## Future Improvements
I'd like to develop the AI further to be more offensive so that it will go for the win when it can.
